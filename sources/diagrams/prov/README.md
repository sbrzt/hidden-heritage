    - `wd:Q3972943 (publishing)`
- an input (`prov:used`) which could be either the physical poster (`schema:CreativeWork`) or its digitised replica (`schema:MediaObject`) at a certain stage of the digitisation process
- an output (`prov:generated`) which is a digitised replica of the physical object (`schema:MediaObject`)
- a previous activity (`prov:wasInformedBy`)
- a person or organisation carrying out tthe digitisation activity (`prov:wasAssociatedWith`), named via `foaf:name`
